#! We are starting to learn about datatypes and the actions that we can perform on them
#! In most programming languages, these actions are called functions. print is function and type is a function which are action that we performed on the datatypes.

#! Here we have a specific Math-Functions such as "round"
print(round(3.9)) #! output will be 4 it will just round the number
print(round(99.5)) #! output will be 100

#! So we also have another Math-Funcion that is built into python is soemthing called as "abs".
#! abs will return the absolute value of the argument.means "NO NEGATIVE NUMBER"
print(abs(-20)) #! output will be 20
print(abs(-1000)) #! output will be 1000

#! there are so many Math-Functions which you can see from below link
