#! What is the difference between expression vs statement?

#! Assume below code and in that expression is iq / 5. Its a piece of code that produces a value
iq = 100
user_age = iq / 5 #! output is 20.0
print(user_age)

#! here user_age - iq / 5 the whole line is called as "STATMENT" iq = 100 this is also a another statment.


#! EXPRESSION = PRODUCE A VALUE 
#! STATEMENT = DATA WHICH WE GIVE TO PRODUCE THAT VALUE IS CALLED STATMENT.
