 #! The idea of using brackets selfish[start:stop:stepover] is called as slicing,
 #! We also need to lear one more which will come again & again, its important
 
 #! IT IS CALLLED IMMUTABILITY
 
 #! Means string are not changed after we added like for exapmle
 
strings = '01234567'
print(strings)

#! we are getting the output but what if i need to changed or need o add 8 after 7?
#! Just remember that we can't reassign part of a string. Once creqated, it exists like that in that form.
