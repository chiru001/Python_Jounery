#! In python lists are a form of array. later we talk different b/w array and lists.

#! Data Structure is a very important concepts in programming languages. It's a way for us to
#! Organized info and data into, lets say a folder or a cupboardd or a box.

#! Thekey here is that the square brackets allow us to contain information and data like strings, integers, booleans etc.

#! example as amazon cart

amazon_cart = ['notebooks', 'sunglasses']  #!so in cart we have 2 iteam now now to access it?

print(amazon_cart[0])
print(amazon_cart[1])
#print(amazon_cart[2]) #! What about this?? there is no iteam 2 so it will shows error
