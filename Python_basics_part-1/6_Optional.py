#! We have an extra datatype which we didn't talk about, and its called "Complex"
#! Complex Data_type

#! We know that integres and float will be stored as binay in memory as 1's & 0's

#! we actually have a function to convert integer to binay that is "BIN"

bin(5) #!output is ? hahahh
print(bin(5)) #!output is 0b101

#! here python will represent as B if you check binary for 5 is 101 so we have 101 before 0b, where B reoresents as Binary.

#! So now we need to retrive the binay number to decimal number ?

print(int('0b101', 2)) #!output is 5

#! 2 is base 2
